# Introduction

This document is a project plan on how to implement the plugin.

## Overview ##

The documentation engine will fit right into the grails structure.  However each manual is a project in itself.

## Directory structure

Document structure is exactly like the **geb** project.  There is a ${project}/doc/${docname} directory, which contains
a ***src*** directory and a ***build*** directory.
